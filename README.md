# Haiku
#### By Elliot Burin & Kimberly Bordon

## Description
_This is an application that will determine if a potential haiku meets haiku line and syllable standards using Javascript. The user will enter their "haiku" and click submit, then a text display will inform of whether it meets the requirements._

## Setup/Installation
* Make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm (Node package manager, which should come automatically) installed.

## Known Bugs
AFAIK, no bugs are known. However, there so many exceptions in the English language, so likely they haven't been accounted for. Please let us know if you spot any.

NEVER MIND. Doesn't work for the word "liar."
